# Introduction

During my 4th semester i felt the need to delve into a bit of hands on machine learning but this time i wanted to develop something new from the ground up instead of doing another one of those typical machine learning projects that you see everybody doing.

So i reached out to one of my professors and she provided me with a csv file that i could try to classify.

So the target class of the csv file was either normal or abnormal and the aim was to train a Machine Learning Model that could classify a given gene into one of those two classes with a good accuracy.

My efforts in doing so were successful and the code for it is in the file 'CSV_Classification.ipynb'

## Trying to improvise

In my first attempt, all i did was apply deep learning and that seemed to do the job but the goal was to develop a Hybrid code that could utilize gradient descent/machine learning model along with a classifier and an optimizer.

All of this this in an attempt to see what the accuracy would be like and to see the levels of overfitting/underfitting if any.

Perhaps we could also overcome the limitation of most classification problem - Sample size.

## The outcome
